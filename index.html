                      <p>Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations.[a] In most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age. There is a movement for education reform, and in particular for evidence-based education with global initiatives aimed at achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all.  </p>

            <h2>The Future of Technology and Innovation</h2>
                   <p>From the moment you wake up, to the moment you go back to sleep, technology is everywhere. The highly digital life we live and the development of our technological world have become the new normal. According to The International Telecommunication Union (ITU), almost 50% of the world’s population uses the internet, leading to over 3.5 billion daily searches on Google and more than 570 new websites being launched each minute. And even more mind-boggling? Over 90% of the world’s data has been created in just the last couple of years.
                   </p>
                   <P>

                    With data growing faster than ever before, the future of technology is even more interesting than what is happening now. We’re just at the beginning of a revolution that will touch every business and every life on this planet. By 2020, at least a third of all data will pass through the cloud, and within five years, there will be over 50 billion smart connected devices in the world.

        <h2>Online Studying/Distance Learning</h2>
               <p>Online institutions are becoming increasingly popular, especially for undergraduate and graduate degrees. Schools like University of the People allow people from all over the world to earn their degrees in various programs with nothing more than an internet connection. Online learning comes its own share of study tips.
               </p>
               <p></p>
               Internet:
               Because these institutions rely on the internet to provide courses, materials and student interaction, begin by ensuring that you have a strong internet connection or find a place where you can use internet without interruptions.
            </p>
            <p>
               Space and Place:
               Be sure to designate a comfortable and quiet place to study from that is conducive to your needs.
               Build a Study Plan:
               One of the greatest things about studying online is the flexibility. But this also means you have increased responsibility to manage time and decide when to log on and learn. That’s why it’s useful to build a study plan and schedule. You can try use something like Study Planner for this, which also includes mind mapping tools that can be useful for tip #9.
            </p>
            <p>
               Ask for Help:
               Distance learning offers student resources like traditional campuses, so don’t be afraid to ask for help from the university’s resources or fellow students. For example, UoPeople grants each student with an academic advisor who is there to answer questions at any time throughout the degree program process.
